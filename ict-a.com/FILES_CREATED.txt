                      ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS
================================================================================

1. NEVER upload .env to public_html - it must stay in /laravel/
2. NEVER set APP_DEBUG=true in production
3. ALWAYS backup before deploying
4. ALWAYS test on a subdomain first if possible
5. ALWAYS set storage/ and bootstrap/cache/ to 775 permissions
6. ALWAYS use https:// in APP_URL, never http://

================================================================================
                    🔐 SECURITY CHECKLIST
================================================================================

Before going live, verify:

□ APP_DEBUG=false in .env
□ APP_ENV=production in .env
□ .env is in /laravel/ NOT public_html
□ Storage permissions are 775
□ Bootstrap/cache permissions are 775
□ HTTPS is working
□ Test: https://www.ict-a.com/.env shows 403 Forbidden
